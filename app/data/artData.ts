      complete_description: `The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in Western culture. Created by Vincent van Gogh in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise.

The painting is dominated by a night sky filled with swirling clouds, stars ablaze with luminescence, and a bright crescent moon. Below the expressive sky is a sleeping village with a prominent church spire outlined against the night sky. To the left, a massive dark cypress tree rises from the hillside like a flame.

The artist's unique technique and emotional state at the time of creation are evident in every brushstroke. Van Gogh applied the paint in thick impasto strokes, creating a sense of movement and energy that seems to make the night sky come alive. The bold colors, particularly the blues and yellows, create a striking contrast that adds to the painting's dramatic effect.

This masterpiece represents more than just a night scene; it's a visualization of cosmic energy and spiritual transcendence. The swirling patterns in the sky reflect van Gogh's turbulent psyche, while also suggesting the infinite and eternal nature of existence. The village below, peaceful and quiet, provides a stark contrast to the dramatic sky above.`,

      reference: "Museum of Modern Art, New York",
      complete_description: `The Persistence of Memory, painted in 1931, is Salvador Dalí's most iconic work and a masterpiece of Surrealism. The painting presents a dreamlike landscape where time itself appears to melt away, symbolized by soft, drooping pocket watches.

The barren landscape features the coast of Catalonia, Dalí's home region, with its characteristic cliffs. In the foreground, a distorted human face lies flat on the ground, appearing almost like a deflated balloon. The melting watches drape themselves over various objects, including the face-like form and a dead tree.

The painting's small size (24 cm × 33 cm) contrasts with its massive influence on art history. Dalí's precise technique, inspired by Renaissance masters, creates an unsettling hyperreality that makes the impossible seem plausible. The artist called this method "hand-painted dream photographs."

The work is often interpreted as a rejection of time as a fixed concept, influenced by Einstein's theory of relativity, which had gained popularity during that period. The ants gathering on one of the watches symbolize decay, while the orange clock covered by a fly suggests the persistence of memory in the face of death.`,

      complete_description: `The Mona Lisa, painted between 1503 and 1519, is considered the most famous painting in the world. This masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci showcases revolutionary artistic techniques and has captivated viewers for centuries with its mysterious allure.

The portrait is believed to be of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. What makes it extraordinary is da Vinci's innovative use of sfumato, a technique of softening outlines and blending colors to create an atmospheric haze. This is particularly evident in the subject's famous smile, which seems to change depending on the viewing angle.

The background landscape is equally remarkable, featuring a winding path and a distant bridge, demonstrating Leonardo's mastery of aerial perspective. The composition creates a sense of depth while maintaining a harmonious balance between the subject and her surroundings.

The painting's technical innovations include the three-quarter pose of the subject, which became a standard for portrait painting, and the psychological depth conveyed through the subject's direct gaze and enigmatic expression. The work represents the pinnacle of Renaissance portraiture and continues to influence artists today.`,

      complete_description: `The Night Watch, painted in 1642, is Rembrandt's most ambitious and innovative masterpiece. The painting's official title is "Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq," though it became commonly known as The Night Watch due to its formerly dark varnish and the dramatic use of light and shadow.

The massive work (363 cm × 437 cm) revolutionized group portraiture by transforming a traditional military group portrait into a dynamic scene of action. Rather than presenting a static line-up of figures, Rembrandt captured the militia company in motion, with members loading muskets, unfurling flags, and readying their weapons.

The painting showcases Rembrandt's masterful use of chiaroscuro - the dramatic contrast between light and dark. The central figures of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch are bathed in golden light, while other members of the militia emerge from or recede into the shadows, creating a sense of depth and movement.

Hidden details and symbols throughout the painting continue to intrigue scholars, from the mysterious small figure of a girl in gold, to the elaborate play of light on weapons and armor. The work represents not just a group portrait, but a complex allegory of civic duty and military might in 17th-century Amsterdam.`,

      complete_description: `The Scream, created by Edvard Munch in 1893, stands as one of the most iconic images in art history and a defining work of the Expressionist movement. The original Norwegian title, "Skrik," translates more accurately to "Shriek," capturing the painting's visceral emotional impact.

Munch created several versions of The Scream using different media. The most famous version uses oil, tempera, and pastel on cardboard. The artist described his inspiration as coming from a walk at sunset, during which the sky turned blood red and he sensed an 'infinite scream passing through nature.'

The central figure, with its skull-like face and wavering form, appears to be both screaming and hearing a scream. The distorted perspective and swirling landscape reflect the figure's inner turmoil, with the fiery sky and dark waters of the fjord echoing the emotional disturbance. The two figures in the background appear oblivious to the protagonist's anguish, enhancing the sense of isolation.

The work has become a universal symbol of anxiety and existential dread in the modern world. Its influence extends far beyond the art world, becoming a widely recognized symbol in popular culture for expressing fear, anxiety, and the overwhelming nature of modern existence.`,

      complete_description: `The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a "head" that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing "exotic dress", an "oriental turban", and what appears to be a very large pearl as an earring. The subject of the painting is unknown, with it being possible either that she was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and mysterious woman, perhaps representing a Sibyl or biblical figure. There has been speculation that she is the artist's eldest daughter, Maria, though this has been dismissed as an anachronism by some art historians.

The work is oil on canvas and is 44.5 cm (17.5 in) high and 39 cm (15 in) wide. It is signed "IVMeer" but not dated. It is estimated to have been painted around 1665.

After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl's gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced. During the restoration, it was discovered that the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was originally a deep enamel-like green. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint—a glaze—over the black background seen now. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded. In 2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke raised doubts about the material of the earring and argued that it looks more like polished tin than pearl on the grounds of the specular reflection, the pear shape and the large size of the earring.`,

      complete_description: `The Birth of Venus (Italian: Nascita di Venere [ˈnaʃʃita di ˈvɛːnere]) is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid-1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of Italian Renaissance painting; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.

They have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.`,

Among his other famous series are his Haystacks.

During the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the Musée de l'Orangerie as a permanent home for eight water lily murals by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death. Sixty water lily paintings from around the globe were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.

Created in response to the bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country town in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy at the request of the Spanish Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War.

The massive oil painting (349.3 cm × 776.6 cm) is rendered entirely in monochromatic tones of black, white, and grey, enhancing its stark, documentary-like quality. The composition is filled with dramatic, fragmented figures: a screaming woman holding a dead child, a bull, a horse in agony, dismembered soldiers, and burning buildings.

Each element in the painting carries symbolic weight: the bull represents the brutality of the attack, the horse symbolizes innocent victims, the light bulb suggests the eye of God or perhaps the bombs themselves, while the woman with the dead child evokes the Pietà. The newspaper-like quality of the grey tones reminds viewers that this was a real event, reported globally.

The painting's style combines elements of Cubism and Surrealism to create a scene of chaos and horror that transcends the specific historical event it depicts. Guernica has become a universal statement against the cruelty of war and a reminder of the devastating impact of conflict on innocent civilians.`,

The ballet tells the story of Princess Odette, who is turned into a swan by the evil sorcerer von Rothbart. Only at night can she return to human form, and only true love can break the spell. Prince Siegfried discovers her and falls in love, but is deceived by Rothbart's daughter Odile, who appears as Odette's dark double.

The music is particularly noteworthy for its symphonic quality and emotional depth. Tchaikovsky's score perfectly captures both the ethereal nature of the swan maidens and the human drama of love and betrayal. The famous "Swan Theme" in Act II has become one of the most recognizable melodies in classical music.

The dual role of Odette/Odile is considered one of the most challenging in ballet, requiring the principal dancer to portray both the delicate, lyrical White Swan and the powerful, seductive Black Swan.

The musical traces Hamilton's extraordinary journey from a Caribbean immigrant to George Washington's right-hand man, to America's first Treasury Secretary. Through its innovative use of contemporary musical styles and color-conscious casting of non-white actors as historical figures, Hamilton reframes the American founding story for a modern audience.

The show's musical complexity is unprecedented in musical theater, featuring dense lyrics that pack in historical detail while maintaining artistic brilliance. Songs like "My Shot," "The Room Where It Happens," and "Wait For It" have become modern classics, combining historical narrative with contemporary resonance.

Beyond its artistic achievements, Hamilton has had a profound cultural impact, making both theater and American history accessible to new audiences.

The opera tells the story of Carmen, a fiery gypsy woman who seduces Don José, a naive soldier. Her free spirit and his obsessive love lead to a tragic confrontation when she leaves him for the charismatic toreador Escamillo. The story challenges 19th-century conventions by presenting a strong, independent female protagonist who defies social norms.

Bizet's score is a masterful blend of Spanish-influenced music and French opera traditions. The opera contains some of classical music's most recognized melodies, including the "Habanera" ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle") and the "Toreador Song." The music brilliantly captures both the local color of Spain and the intense emotions of the characters.

Though initially controversial for its portrayal of working-class life and tragic ending, Carmen has become a cornerstone of the operatic repertoire.

The plot follows four young Athenian lovers and a group of amateur actors who become entangled in a dispute between Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies. The fairy Puck's misuse of a love potion creates chaos and confusion, leading to a series of comical misunderstandings and transformations, including turning one of the actors, Bottom, into a donkey.

The play masterfully blends elements of classical mythology, English folklore, and Renaissance court culture. Shakespeare's language ranges from noble blank verse for the aristocratic characters to earthy prose for the amateur actors, while the fairies speak in lyrical rhyming couplets that enhance the magical atmosphere.

This enchanting work has inspired countless adaptations across all performing arts, from ballet and opera to film and modern theater.

      complete_description: `The Rite of Spring(French: Le Sacre du printemps) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a "riot" or "near-riot", though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later.Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.

Stravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911). The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, "Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Léonide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances. Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.

Stravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.`,

Inspired by William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, the story is set in the mid-1950s in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, then a multiracial, blue-collar neighborhood. The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The Sharks, who are recent migrants from Puerto Rico, and the Jets, who are white, vie for dominance of the neighborhood, and the police try to keep order. The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang's leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, tragic love story, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre.

The original 1957 Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Robbins, marked Sondheim's Broadway debut. It ran for 732 performances before going on tour. The production was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, in 1958, winning two. The show had an even longer-running West End production, a number of revivals, and international productions. A 1961 musical film adaptation, co-directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won ten, including Best Picture. A 2021 film adaptation, directed by Steven Spielberg was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with six additional nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress.`,

      complete_description: `Giselle , originally titled Giselle, ou les Wilis (French: [ʒizɛl u le vili]; Giselle, or The Wilis), is a romantic ballet (ballet-pantomime) in two acts with music by Adolphe Adam. Considered a masterwork in the classical ballet performance canon, it was first performed by the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on 28 June 1841, with Italian ballerina Carlotta Grisi as Giselle. It was an unqualified triumph. It became hugely popular and was staged at once across Europe, Russia, and the United States.

The ghost-filled ballet tells the tragic, romantic story of a beautiful young peasant girl named Giselle and a disguised nobleman named Albrecht, who fall in love, but when his true identity is revealed by his rival, Hilarion, Giselle goes mad and dies of heartbreak. After her death, she is summoned from her grave into the vengeful, deadly sisterhood of the Wilis, the ghosts of unmarried women who died after being betrayed by their lovers and take revenge in the night by dancing men to death by exhaustion (a popular theme in Romantic-era ballets). Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they target Albrecht when he comes to mourn at Giselle's grave, but her great love frees him from their grasp. They gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions, creating an ethereal atmosphere that builds as they gradually close in on Albrecht. By saving him from the Wilis, Giselle also saves herself from becoming one of them.

Librettists Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Théophile Gautier took their inspiration for the plot from a prose passage about the Wilis in De l'Allemagne, by Heinrich Heine, and from a poem called "Fantômes" in Les Orientales by Victor Hugo.

Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot created the original choreography. The role of Giselle was created for Carlotta Grisi as her debut piece for the Paris public, and she was the only ballerina to dance it at the Paris Opera for many years. The traditional choreography that has been passed down to the present day derives primarily from the revivals staged by Marius Petipa during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg. One of the world's most-often performed classical ballets, it is also one of the most challenging to dance.`,

Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, it tells the tragic story of beautiful soprano Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious and disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opéra House.

The musical opened in London's West End in 1986 and on Broadway in New York in 1988, in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring English classical soprano Sarah Brightman (Lloyd Webber's then-wife) as Christine Daaé, screen and stage star Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and international stage performer Steve Barton as Raoul. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, with Crawford winning the Olivier and Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. A film adaptation, directed by Joel Schumacher, was released in 2004.

The Phantom of the Opera was the longest running show in Broadway history, and celebrated its 10,000th performance on 11 February 2012, becoming the first Broadway production in history to do so. It is the second longest-running West End musical, after Les Misérables, and the third longest-running West End show overall, after The Mousetrap. With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $6 billion and total Broadway gross of over $1 billion, The Phantom of the Opera was the most financially successful entertainment event until The Lion King surpassed it in 2014. By 2019, it had been seen by over 140 million people in 183 cities across 41 countries.

The original West End production at His Majesty's Theatre, London, ended its run in 2020, its run cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. A new production of Phantom, with a "smaller orchestra and redesigned set", opened in the same theatre in July 2021. The original Broadway production played its final performance on 16 April 2023.

The story begins with José Arcadio Buendía founding Macondo and follows his descendants through a century of triumphs, failures, loves, and losses. The narrative weaves together the extraordinary and the mundane, where ghosts coexist with the living, and miracles are treated as everyday occurrences.

Márquez's unique storytelling style blends historical events from Colombia's past with fantastic elements, creating a rich tapestry that explores themes of time, fate, and the cyclical nature of history. The novel's complex family tree, with characters sharing names across generations, reinforces the idea of history repeating itself.

The work is celebrated for its profound influence on Latin American literature and world fiction. It challenges traditional narrative structures while examining solitude, love, war, and the human condition. The novel's final pages, revealing the family's destiny written in ancient prophecies, create one of literature's most memorable endings.`,

This epic poem follows Dante's allegorical journey through the three realms of the afterlife: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise).

Written in the first person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms, guided first by the Roman poet Virgil and then by Beatrice, Dante's ideal woman. Each realm is depicted in 33 cantos, with an introductory canto making a total of 100. The poem's complex structure reflects medieval beliefs about the perfection of numbers.

The work is remarkable for its vivid imagery and inventive punishments in Hell, the hopeful penitence of Purgatory, and the sublime beauty of Paradise. Dante populated his afterlife with historical figures, mythological characters, and contemporaries, creating a work that is both universal and deeply personal.

The Divine Comedy revolutionized literature by being written in vernacular Italian rather than Latin, helping to establish the Tuscan dialect as Italy's literary language. Its influence extends far beyond literature, inspiring countless artists, musicians, and writers across centuries, from Botticelli to T.S. Eliot.`,

It was originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615. Considered a founding work of Western literature, it is often said to be the first modern novel. The novel has been labelled by many well-known authors as the "best book of all time" and the "best and most central work in world literature". Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world[6] and one of the best-selling novels of all time.

The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He recruits as his squire a simple farm labourer, Sancho Panza, who brings a unique, earthy wit to Don Quixote's lofty rhetoric. In the first part of the book, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story meant for the annals of all time. However, as Salvador de Madariaga pointed out in his Guía del lector del Quijote (1972 [1926]), referring to "the Sanchification of Don Quixote and the Quixotization of Sancho", as "Sancho's spirit ascends from reality to illusion, Don Quixote's declines from illusion to reality".

The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers (1844), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897) as well as the word quixotic. Mark Twain referred to the book as having "swept the world's admiration for the mediaeval chivalry-silliness out of existence".It has been described by some as the greatest work ever written.`,

It is regarded, with Anna Karenina, as Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, and it remains an internationally praised classic of world literature.

The book chronicles the French invasion of Russia and its aftermath during the Napoleonic era. It uses five interlocking narratives following different Russian aristocratic families to illustrate Napoleon's impact on Tsarist society. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869.

Tolstoy said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to classify War and Peace, saying it is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle." Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative. He regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.`,

      complete_description: `The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (/ˈhæmlɪt/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is considered among the "most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language", with a story capable of "seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others". It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time. Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.

Many works have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare's play, from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan dramas. The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of "source hunting", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's Hamlet, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after Hamlet had been written, though it is possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.`,

The original manuscript no longer exists. It was made in "concertina" or orihon style: several sheets of paper pasted together and folded alternately in one direction then the other.

The work is a unique depiction of the lifestyles of high courtiers during the Heian period. It is written in archaic language and a poetic style that requires specialised study. In the early 20th century Genji was translated into modern Japanese by the poet Akiko Yosano. The first English translation of Genji was made in 1882 by Suematsu Kencho, but was of poor quality and left incomplete. Arthur Waley translated an almost complete version which excludes only the 38th chapter (Suzumushi/The Bell Cricket) between 1925 to 1933. Since then, complete English translations have been made by Edward Seidensticker, Royall Tyler, and Dennis Washburn.

The work recounts the life of Hikaru Genji, or "Shining Genji". Genji is the son of the emperor (known to readers as Emperor Kiritsubo) and a low-ranking concubine called Kiritsubo Consort, but for political reasons the emperor removes Genji from the line of succession, demoting him to commoner status by giving him the surname Minamoto. Genji then pursues a career as an imperial officer. The tale concentrates on Genji's romantic life and describes the customs of the aristocratic society of the time. It is one of history's first novels, the first by a woman to have won global recognition, and in Japan today has a stature like that of Shakespeare in England.`,

Like the Iliad, the Odyssey is divided into 24 books. It follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his journey home after the Trojan War. After the war, which lasted ten years, his journey from Troy to Ithaca, via Africa and southern Europe, lasted for ten additional years during which time he encountered many perils and all of his crewmates were killed. In his absence, Odysseus was assumed dead, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus had to contend with a group of unruly suitors who were competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.

The Odyssey was originally composed in Homeric Greek in around the 8th or 7th century BC and, by the mid-6th century BC, had become part of the Greek literary canon. In antiquity, Homer's authorship of the poem was not questioned, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently and that the stories formed as part of a long oral tradition. Given widespread illiteracy, the poem was performed by an aoidos or rhapsode and was more likely to be heard than read.

Crucial themes in the poem include the ideas of nostos (νόστος; 'return'), wandering, xenia (ξενία; 'guest-friendship'), testing, and omens. Scholars still reflect on the narrative significance of certain groups in the poem, such as women and slaves, who have a more prominent role in the epic than in many other works of ancient literature. This focus is especially remarkable when contrasted with the Iliad, which centres the exploits of soldiers and kings during the Trojan War.

The Odyssey is regarded as one of the most significant works of the Western canon. The first English translation of the Odyssey was in the 16th century. Adaptations and re-imaginings continue to be produced across a wide variety of media. In 2018, when BBC Culture polled experts around the world to find literature's most enduring narrative, the Odyssey topped the list.`,

It is widely regarded as Chaucer's magnum opus. The tales (mostly written in verse, although some are in prose) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return.

It has been suggested that the greatest contribution of The Canterbury Tales to English literature was the popularisation of the English vernacular in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—John Gower, William Langland, the Pearl Poet, and Julian of Norwich—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.

The Canterbury Tales is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue, some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). It is revered as one of the most important works in English literature.`,

Nearly all of Part One and the majority of Part Two are written in rhymed verse. Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is considered by many to be Goethe's magnum opus and the greatest work of German literature.

The earliest forms of the work, known as the Urfaust, were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are not entirely clear. Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.

The first appearance of the work in print was Faust, a Fragment, published in 1790. Goethe completed a preliminary version of what is now known as Part One in 1806. Its publication in 1808 was followed by the revised 1828–29 edition, the last to be edited by Goethe himself.

Goethe finished writing Faust, Part Two in 1831; it was published posthumously the following year. In contrast to Faust, Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years.`,
